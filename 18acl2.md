Basic

Vtecx manages resources in hierarchical order. So it's more likely a filesystem in Linux or Windows architecture. Just like adding a directory inside a parent directory. So what we want is to add permission to these folders and subfolders for various users.

You can set access permissions (ACL: Access Control List) for contents and folders, access control such as public / private settings can be performed for each user or group. You can set validation rules, ACLs, indexes, encryption, etc. for each item.

Let's Create some users and attach them as a contributor. Then we’ll attach permission to those contributors.

Add User

post http://localhost:8000/d/?_adduserByAdmin

Let's add a user. We’ll send a feed to endpoint _addUserByAdmin API. This piece of code will add a user named Rasel

export const addUser = () => {
  const hashpass = vtecxauth.getHashpass('123456') // it's needed to hash the password
  const account = 'rasel@mail.com'
  const userName = 'Rasel'

  let reqdata = {
    feed: {
      entry: [
        {
          contributor: [{
            uri: 'urn:vte.cx:auth:' + account + ',' + hashpass,
            name: userName
          }]
        }
      ]
    }
  }

  axios({
    url: '/d/?_adduserByAdmin',
    method: 'post',
    headers: {
      'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'
    },
    data: reqdata
  })
}

Some tips about the API

Only Admin user can send a request to _addUserByAdmin. To check your role send a request to get d/_group/$admin?f&x and match your uid there.
And you can add multiple users by adding multiple objects to the request feed contributor :[{uri:’…’, name:’…’}, {uri:’…’, name:’…’}, …]
So we’ve already assumed that we’ve products now we have users We can check all our product entry by get /d/product?f&x. We can check all our product ACL by get /d/product?e&x. The response may not include any ACL for this request now but by default, it has all privileges for the admin user. Now we want to give Mr. Customer read only permission. So we gonna send a request to put /d/?_post. And the request feed will be like

const uid = '69920'
  const permissions = 'R'

  let reqdata = {
    feed: {
      entry: [
        {
          link: [
            {
              ___rel: 'self',
              ___href: '/product'
            }
          ],
          contributor: [
            {
              uri: 'urn:vte.cx:acl:/_group/$admin,CRUD'
            },
            {
              uri: 'urn:vte.cx:acl:/_group/$useradmin,CRUD/'
            },
            {
              uri: `urn:vte.cx:acl:${uid},${permissions}`
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }

contributor: See we’ve added Mr. Customer as a contributor and s/he only got Read access We’ve added two other groups $admin and $useradmin with all permissions (C=create, R=read, U=update, D=delete).
