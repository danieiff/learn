My WEV DEV
Firebase Vercel Next.js CMS Graphql ...various requirements and limitaion for a customer
Database postgresql

For multiple platforms, mobile and web
Graphql, Firebase (due to a clientside query)

Graphql and Database is complex, and this stack is for a bigger team in a company. This means that your responsibility is minimum over there.
So, you should choose firebase and focus on Frontend programming for application logics and rich features. It will reduce your stress and make coding in a work, more comfortable. with a minimum backend written with Typescript.

A Human resource is the highest bottleneck.
In a company,
salary is guarantee and cash flow is securely locked in a system. And  they would not pay more for you.
You should make an effort with plans and make sure that it will pay for you.

Backend is essentially not complex. It must be simple and clear.
Frontend dev is personal battlefield, but Backend is for a team unless you are completely skilled and have a much confidence in it.
You can get used to other stacks, Graphql, RDB and CMS, though the work in a company.
Even you couldn't fully utilize these stacks all. And anything else, you have to save a time for yourself.
If you are young, a company wouldn't pay for such backend skilled younger developer.
